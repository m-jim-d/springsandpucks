      <br/><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Direct P2P connections established with a remote
		  <br>Node.js server</div>
   </div>
   <p>
   A P2P layer has been added to the multiplayer functionality for the demos. The socket.io connectivity described on the 
   original <a href="multiplayer.html">multiplayer page</a> is still in place 
   and facilitates P2P and also acts as a backup if 
   P2P connections can't be established.</p>
	<p>
    P2P offers only a minor performance 
	advantage when compared to the local Node.js server configuration 
	represented in Figure 1. The time consumed in sending mouse and keyboard 
	data through a middle-man is small when all computers 
	are on the same local network.</p>
	<p>
    A key drawback with this configuration is the required installation of a Node.js server 
	onto the host computer. It's a simple install but any install can be a 
	barrier to the recruiting process for a multiplayer game.</p>
	<p>
    Prior to now, the <a href="index.html">demo</a> page, in multiplayer mode, 
	ran with the default Node.js server being a remote one, at Heroku (like 
	Figure 1, but with the yellow circle far outside the local network). No 
	install needed. But the time-of-flight lag, back and forth to Heroku, is 
	quite noticeable especially in mouse movements projected to the host. This 
	lag (latency) is a key drawback of the non-local node server. Even more so, this lag 
	is a hindrance to any kind of 
	synchronized play between users on different networks.</p>
	<p>An alternative to synchronizing two physics engines is to stream (P2P) 
	the rendered result from the host's canvas out to a video element on the 
	client page. Client mouse movements (over the video element) and keyboard 
	events are sent to the host, interacting with the host physics engine. Using 
	only one engine, two users can play in different physical rooms, networks, 
	states, countries...</p>
	<p>As the educational (classroom) applications of this site are considered, 
	the advantages of P2P connections become clear:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>No installation</li>
		<li>Snappy lag-free mouse and keyboard performance using a WebRTC 
		datachannel</li>
		<li>Video streaming from the host's canvas out to the clients</li>
		<li>The potential for synchronized play with remote clients</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And so began a time of wandering through the online documentation for WebRTC, a P2P 
	protocol that is native now in most browsers.</p>
   <h2>WebRTC</h2>
	<p>
    The diagram in Figure 2 shows the current default configuration for multiplayer. 
	The thin lines represent the socket.io connections that continue to support 
	the chat feature and now the signaling process for the WebRTC 
	connections.</p>
	<p>
    Signaling is the process by which the clients and host exchange their 
	network configuration data needed for NAT traversal, etc. It depends on 
	having a server that is accessible from all computers involved. That means a public server, like the default Heroku server used here, or a 
	computer inside your local network.</p>
	<p>
    Figure 2 shows an example where host and clients are on the same local 
	network. This reflects the same-physical-room setup that has been discussed 
	here; everyone looking at the same display, maybe a projection. Video-stream 
	functionality has been recently added (using the P2P connection of WebRTC). 
	This allows players to be in different rooms, states, countries. </p>
	<p>
    The Node server is shown at a distant location in Figure 2. Since its role 
	now is mainly to establish the P2P connection, its location can be anywhere 
	without reducing performance.</p>
	<p>
    The Heroku server has Node.js running on a free account. By default, the 
	host and client pages use this distant Heroku server for signaling 
	activities. If the default server is used, which is done by leaving the 
	"server" field set to triquence.herokuapp.com, 
	there is no installation task needed to try the P2P and multiplayer features here. If your 
	network environment/security blocks the WebRTC signaling process, you can 
	try installing the node-server code on a local server following the 
	instructions <a href="multiplayer.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>
    The following ping-test result is along the P2P connection (local WiFi) to 
	the u6 client. Fast! Even a little faster than the result from a local node 
	server.</p>
	<img alt="ping" src="images/ping4.png" />
	<p>A few useful things to know:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The letters, "P2P", are displayed on the client's canvas (the 
		colored horizontal bar under the client's "Chat" button) when the 
		WebRTC connection succeeds. The color of the bar indicates the color of 
		the client's cursor and jet tube.</li>
		<li>The P2P connection can be toggled on/off by using shift-p on the 
		client. When P2P is 
		off, the socket.io connection, via the Node.js server, is used. You can 
		get a good sense for the lag reduction by making a circular mouse 
		pattern on a client, both with P2P on and off, and watching the rendered 
		mouse movements on the host.</li>
		<li>If you're looking through the code here it's helpful to remember 
		that the host side of the each WebRTC connection is stored as an 
		attribute of the corresponding Client object; one connection for each 
		client. On the client side, there is only one WebRTC connection, i.e. a 
		connection to the host (no client-client connectivity).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All the network magic is contained 
	in three files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Two files for the Node.js server: <a href="package.json.html">package.json</a> and
		<a href="server.js.html">server.js</a>, and </li>
		<li>One file used by the host and client pages:
		<a href="hostAndClient.js.html">hostAndClient.js</a>.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>An outline of the P2P connection process as commented in the code 
	(hostAndClient.js):</p>
<pre>
   Host: 
      starting with the "Create" button, runs "connect_and_listen" to establish socket.io connection with server. 
      io.connect and init_socket_listeners are run
   Server: 
      on connection, listeners are initialized on the server for that connection
      server automatically sends to "connect" listener on host
   Host: 
      from "connect" listener, host sends to "roomJoin" listener on server with room name as indicated on the host's page
   Server: 
      from "roomJoin" listener, server sets up the room, adds the host to the room as host, 
      and sends to "room-joining-message" listener on host: (1) you joined room, (2) you are host
   Client (and Server): 
      Starting with the "Connect" button, the client makes a similar (like the host's above) exchange with the server to establish 
      the socket.io connection and join the room as a member (not as host).
      The server sends to the "your name is" listener on the client where the rtc object is instantiated and openDataChannel is run.
      openDataChannel( false, clientName); // client run this as NOT the initiator 
         the guts of the WebRTC is instantiated ----> new RTCPeerConnection
         onicecandidate event handler established which uses the "signaling message" listeners
         ondatachannel handler is defined (responds to data channel initiation by the host)
   Server: 
      At the end of the client connection process an additional step is done in the server's "roomJoin" listener. 
      The server sends the new client name to the "new-game-client" listener on the host. 
   Host: 
      "new-game-client" listener instantiates a new Client object where the host-side of each P2P connection, for each client, exists:
         createNetworkClient(...)
      Then these two calls start the P2P connection process:
         openDataChannel( true, clientName); // host opens as the initiator
            the guts of the WebRTC is instantiated ----> new RTCPeerConnection
            onicecandidate event handler established
               handler will send ICE info to the server's "signaling message" listener, then relayed to the client's listener.
            createDataChannel: starts the datachannel on the host; client responds with its ondatachannel handler
         createOffer
            an offer is forwarded to the client using the "signaling message" listeners
   Client:
      "signaling message" listener
         handleOffer
            cl.rtc.pc.setRemoteDescription
            cl.rtc.pc.createAnswer
            cl.rtc.pc.setLocalDescription( answer);
            an answer is sent to the Host via "signaling message" listeners
   Host:
      "signaling message" listener
         handleAnswer
            cl.rtc.pc.setRemoteDescription( answer)
