	<ul>
		<li>August, 2024
      <ul>
         <li>Added "sort capture" to the "remove/add items" select-list of procedures. 
         This sorts the pucks in the capture and renames pucks, springs, and joints with an increasing index. 
         This provides a nomenclature cleanup, indexes starting at #1 and consecutive.      
      </ul>
      <li>July, 2024
      <ul>
         <li>Enlisted shot-lock (ctrl-shift-L keys) and shot-speeds (z key) in captures.
      </ul>   
		<li>June, 2024
      <ul>
         <li>Added cloud storage of captures: 
         post (P button), 
         update (P button with shift key down), 
         delete (P button with shift and ctrl keys down), 
         a subset list for the current demo index (? button), 
         and a full listing (? button with shift key down). 
         Click the links in the list table to download and run a capture (cloud storage facilitated by a Cloudflare worker and their KV storage).
			<li>In Bipartisan Hoops, all but the last shot are now limited to 2 
			minutes. There's a one-minute warning, then a message at two-minutes indicating 
			that one last shot can be taken.
         <li>Added an "edit" column to the leaderboard report. This tracks 
         editing events during each game. A hover tip in the column header 
         explains the single-letter codes that indicate event types. This is 
         intended to encourage hacking (editor use facilitating higher scores) 
         in the time-limited Bipartisan Hoops and the other games too.
         <li>"Align selected" now also applies to the dimensional attributes of pucks and walls.
		</ul>
		<li>May, 2024
      <ul>
       <li>New civics-lesson version of <a href="index.html?5e.basketball-par">Bipartisan Hoops</a>:
       <ul>
          <li>Players are party mascots with associated historical facts 
          about the two parties (and one for independents).<li>Hired a 
          better referee. So there are now restrictions on dropping shots 
          into the basket (goal tending) and being too close to the 
          basket (too easy).<li>Added scoring for trick shots: successful 
          shots where shooting is to the right (away from the basket).
          <li>Added scoring bonus for "fling" shots (if ctrl-shift-lock is 
          toggled off). This is simple cursor-spring shooting without 
          projectile forecasts.</ul>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Submit "noname" in the chat field to go back to being anonymous.
         </ul>
		<li>April, 2024
         <ul>
			 <li>Nickname and team-name checks (for similar names already in use) 
			on the leaderboard and the multiplayer server. Caution messages displayed with color 
			background in the chat history.
         </ul>
		<li>March, 2024
         <ul>
			 <li>
			 <a href="mouseandkeys.html" target="_blank" title="mice, keys, and touch">Reference</a> page on mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen usage.<li>Team feature for game play: Team name is (optionally) indicated by adding it to the nickname with an @ sign. 
         Example: bill@green, indicates bill is on the green team. 
         Team scores are reported to the leaderboard. Friendly fire is prevented between team members.
         	<li>Leaderboard query feature: The host can query (from the multiplayer chat field) the leaderboard results for a game 
			without playing it. Example: lb::7.a
         	<li>Updated the network "help" command that runs from the multiplayer chat field (must be connected).
         </ul>
		<li>January, 2024<ul>
			<li>Moved to triquence.org.</ul>
		<li>December, 2023<ul>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="index.html?EpLReport">EpL and Speed</a> reports
			<li>Demos illustrating inelastic collisions: 
            <a target="_blank" href="index.html?4c.inelastic">4c.inelastic</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="index.html?5b">5b</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="index.html?5b.two">5b.two</a>, and (5b.four, 5b.five, and 5b.six inside the page fold).
            <!-- <a target="_blank" href="index.html?5b.four">5b.four</a> -->
			<li>Closed-form predictions of final state:
            These are spreadsheet-like calculators for the 5b, 5b.two, 5b.four, 5b.six, and 5a.orbitingOnSpring demos. After making a final-state
            prediction, the engine can be run using the calculator's "run" button and its row of initial conditions.
            <li>History of page-level links:
            With the "Ctrl" and "Shift" keys down, use the left/right arrow keys to step through the history of page links that have
            been clicked (the up-arrow key jumps to the top of the page).
            <li>The position of attachment and multi-select points update so as to scale well with puck-dimensional edits. 
            Demos where this helps (i.e. ones with non-COM attachments) include 5a, 5e, and 5f.
            Used this feature in making this demo: 
			<a target="_blank" href="index.html?5a.threeAndOne">5a.threeAndOne</a>
		</ul>
		<li>September, 2023<ul>
			<li>An Android update revealed a need for change in the Two-Thumbs 
			virtual game pad... While functionally the same, it now establishes 
			state based on events, then repaints the whole canvas each frame 
			using an animation loop. Previously, sub-section repaints were done 
			directly in response to events.</ul>

		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>added an hsl object for supporting demos that step through 
				the HSL color space. To try this, paste "hsl(50, 100%, 0%)" into 
				a puck's color attribute. Run the modified capture and then 
				recapture to see the hsl object that gets created for the puck. 
				In it you can edit the color-step size (default is 2).</li>
			<li>added S &amp; L buttons to save and load captures to the local file

		<li>August, 2022<ul>
			<li>Upgraded <em>Monkey Hunt</em> and <em>Bipartisan Hoops</em> to 
			be playable games, including connections to the leaderboard. These 
			projectile games can be fully controlled from a touch screen. A 
			second-finger touch toggles the fine-moves for precise aiming.<li>separate module for Monkey Hunt</ul>

			<li>"Run" button: an alternate way to play a capture<li>A capture 
			can be immediately taken after starting a demo (before the engine 
			alters the state) by clicking the "Run" button<br />while holding the shift key down. This can be used to get an updated 
			copy of an existing capture. This is also a good way to<br />take an un-altered (0th frame) capture of the "a" versions of the 
			demos.<li>separate module for capture and restore<li>separate module

				<li>exit stage left</ul>
			<li>Added reporting of pendulum and spring periods (and their ratio) 
			when the spring is selected in demo 5c.<li>shift-alt-s as first step 
			to produce a capture without softconstraints key<li>shift-s now 
			reports the spring nature of the springs in multiselect.<li>Added 
			features for quantifying the lag of rendered cursor on canvas 
			relative to system cursor. User must have "lagtest" in chat field 
			before checking the local-cursor box under multiplayer. This coupled 
			with p (stop the game loop) and alt-p (inhibit erasing) provide info 
			on mouse input delay.<li>Added feature to automatically restart the 
			game loop after actions, such as changing to full-screen, that 
			affect cursor lag.<li>"Tab" key steps through a menu for multiselect 
			operations. For the spring and revolute options in the tab menu, the 
			"enter" key steps through, and gives focus to individual springs 
			and revolute joints.<li>Monkey Hunt demo, 4e.<li>For non-colliding 
			objects, the top object (drawn last), is always the one that is 
			cursor selected.</ul>
		<li>April, 2022<ul>
			<li>Spring report is displayed (including stretch amount), for a selected spring.<li>Tab key presents 
			delete options for multi-selected compound objects.<li>Alt-c now 
			works in two steps: the first alt-c acts to center the selection 
			point in the middle of the narrowest dimension, the second alt-c 
			acts to push the selection point out to the nearest end.<li>Added 
			collision detection, shot logic, and corresponding screen comments 
			to the bipartisan hoops game. See bpHoops.js module.<li>videos:<ul>

		</ul>
		<li>November, 2021
         <ul>
			 <li>Added alignment feature for objects in the multi-select group. See "align selected" under "remove/add items." Alternately, use alt-l to run it.
			</ul>
		<li>October, 2021
         <ul>
			 <li>Applied revolute joint in double-compound pendulum (see 
			 <a href="index.html?5f">5f</a>). Added feature (drawDuringPE attribute) to inhibit drawing
         of a specific puck while in pause-erase mode (alt-p).
			 <li>Added fixed-length variation of the distance joint. Applied it
         for Newton's cradle demos (see demo <a href="index.html?5h">5h</a>).</ul>
		<li>July, 2021<ul>
			<li>"remove/add items" select control for clearing off the canvas 
			and then adding stuff: springs, pucks, walls, pins etc.<li>Added "Joints" prototype in Constructors and Prototypes module.<li>Added "revolute joint" and "chain" to the "remove/add items" select 
			control. Also see demo <a href="index.html?5e">5e</a>.</ul>
		<li>April, 2021<ul>
			<li>Touch-screen play of ghost-ball pool for the host computer, 
			useful for playing on a tablet.<li>Finemove toggle, the b key, 
			useful for disengaging the ghost-ball from target balls, or turning 
			finemoves on/off in other demos.<li>Shot history stepper, alt-b and 
			alt-n, step you back and forth through the shot history.<li>Refined 
			the ghost-ball visualization to include indications for:
			<ul>
				<li>non-ideal (non pool-ball) collisions,<li>glancing angles, 
				<li>around-other-objects shots,<li>post-collision path lines.</ul>
			<li>Moved ghost-ball code into a module, ghostBall.js.</ul>
		<li>February, 2021<ul>
			<li>Finemoves algorithm added for Ghost-Ball pool game. When the 
			ghostball touches an object ball or cushion, the resolution of the 
			mouse movement is increased by a factor of about 7. This improves 
			aiming accuracy. After disengaging from the target, ghostball 
			movement reverts to the normal 1 to 1.</ul>
		<li>January, 2021<ul>
			<li>Several new network commands (enter in the chat) for the host:<ul>
				<li><strong>rr</strong>: room report<li><strong>dcir</strong>: 
				disconnect all clients in the room<li><strong>ping:p2p-uNNN</strong>: 
				ping test along P2P path to user uNNN<li><strong>dbrtc:on
				</strong>or <strong>dbrtc:off</strong>: turn on/off debug 
				logging for WebRTC in the browser console (ctrl-shift-i)</ul>
			<li>Mapping function for Ghost Ball pool that effectively stretches 
			out the surface of a cellphone (controlling shots) making it easier 
			to reach the table cushions<li>Changed behavior in Ghost-Ball when 
			two clients are addressing the same ball. First player 
			addressing the ball now maintains control.<li>Put code for virtual 
			game pad into separate module.</ul>
		<li>September, 2020<ul>
			<li>Enlisted the Ghost-Ball Pool game into the leaderboard reporting 
			and added game-rule governance and feedback that runs during game 
			play.</ul>
		<li>July, 2020<ul>
			<li>Dandelion demo: <a href="index.html?5d">5d</a>. Demonstration of 
			image rotation and dissimilar drag characteristics in a compound 
			object. Also makes a good object to launch into the air (with 
			gravity on) using the pool-shot feature.</ul>
		<li>June, 2020<ul>
			<li>Added ghost-ball feature for cue-ball shots off the cushion.<li>Touch-screen features added for ghost-ball pool. You can aim and 
			shoot from your cell phone (use the desktop client from your phone 
			to connect to a host computer).</ul>
		<li>May, 2020<ul>
			<li>Pool-shot feature for aiming and shooting a puck: <br />Try some pool shots in demo 
			<a href="https://triquence.org/?3d">3d</a>, 
			Ghost-Ball Pool. Instructions are displayed at the beginning of the 
			game and in the left panel.<li>Updated the network client to support the features of Ghost-Ball 
			Pool. Nice!</ul>
		<li>April, 2020<ul>
			<li>Video <a href="videos.html">walkthrough page</a> and
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNULhG6uVP0&amp;list=PLTMmJ3C3RoL9fD2v7BqE20FDQWL-fVcjg">playlist</a> including 
			videos on the cell phone interface (virtual game pad) for Puck 
			Popper.<li>The combination of the "alt" and "p" keys toggle the 
			canvas eraser on/off. The eraser normally precedes each frame. When 
			toggled off, some drawing features, such as for springs, are 
			inhibited.</ul>
		<li>March, 2020<ul>
			<li>Client names (or nicknames) are displayed above the client 
			pucks, at game start, and when "?" key or client-color square is 
			touched on the virtual game pad.<li>CV checkbox for optionally 
			displaying the drone pucks as Coronaviruses.</ul>
		<li>February, 2020<ul>
			<li>Adapted the client page to run in both desktop mode:
			<a href="https://triquence.org/client.html">triquence.org/client.html</a>, and mobile-friendly mode:
			<a href="https://triquence.org/client.html?m">triquence.org/client.html?m</a>. 
			The mobile version offers the most direct path the Two Thumbs game 
			pad. The desktop version supports all the streaming and 
			cursor-related options, and yes, can be used from a cell phone.<li>Virtual game pad changes:<ul>
				<li>Reversed the jet control so that the touch point sets the 
				direction of the nose cone, not the jet tube.<li>Revised the "scope" control to have a sweep rate indicator. 
				The result of the sweeping action, the tube angle, is now 
				transmitted from the host to the client, and rendered there. The 
				gun and jet tube angles are synced with the host when Puck 
				Popper is started or when the Two Thumbs game pad is started or 
				reset.<li>The color square on the Two Thumbs game pad now 
				indicates, with a black dot, whether the client has a puck or 
				not.</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>January, 2020<ul>
			<li>Split the main code module into three parts. Links to the new 
			code modules are in the tour (first topic in the outline).</ul>
		<li>November, 2019<ul>
			<li>"Canvas" button enlarges the canvas to match the size and aspect 
			ratio of the screen (view port). When using this button, the 
			perimeter fence (in the physics world) is enlarged to match the 
			dimensions of the larger canvas.</ul>
		<li>July, 2019<ul>
			<li>Added the PiEngine class to gwModule.js. This is a javascript 
			version of the algorithm for calculating pi digits
			<a href="https://pet.triquence.org/?countpi" target="_blank">originally</a> written in Python. The 
			<a href="index.html?1d">1d</a> and <a href="index.html?1e">1e</a> demos use PiEngine.</ul>
		<li>June, 2019<ul>
			<li>Demo <a href="index.html?1c">1c</a> presents an unusual method for calculating the first two digits of pi (31) using two elastically colliding pucks.<li>Removed the page folds in the left panel. Added an outline of topics 
			at the top. Should be more context sensitive now and better 
			summarized by search engines.</ul>
		<li>May, 2019<ul>
			<li>For demo 2, changed how wave speed is specified, now in units of 
			pixels per frame (see propSpeed_ppf_px in captures). This gives 
			consistent rendering, independent of device frame rate.<li>Demo 
			<a href="index.html?2c">2c</a> makes use of 
			a new option to specify the object speed in Mach number.<li>Demo 
			<a href="index.html?2e">2e</a> incorporates hsl( hue, saturation%, lightness%) color 
			for the pulse rings. The hue level is incremented 3 points between 
			each pulse ring. The saturation and lightness levels can be edited 
			in the capture.<li>Added a second video to the
			<a href="https://pet.triquence.org?perfect-kiss" target="_blank">Perfect Kiss topic</a> (on the Python page). This demonstrates the 
			reversibility of the Perfect Kiss algorithm.</ul>
		<li>April, 2019<ul>
			<li>YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAeRF1GOurA" target="_blank">video</a> 
			on the keyboard interface for playing Puck Popper.<li>Refined the capture process 
			to produce a more concise and editable JSON recording.<li>The 
			"Reverse" button flips the velocity and reverses the rotation rate 
			of each puck.<li>Enlisted the Jello Madness game into the 
			leaderboard reporting. Try untangling <a href="index.html?6a">6a</a> and 
			<a href="index.html?6d">6d</a>. How does your time 
			compare?<li>Changed the local launching point for the drone bullets 
			to originate from the center of the drone pucks (not the end of 
			their guns). This is more compatible with the algorithm that 
			calculates the leading angle need to anticipate the movement of the 
			targets. So the drones are even sharper shooters now.<li>Changed the 
			starting puck position and velocity, for the first four network 
			players in Puck Popper, to be consistent, not random as before. This 
			provides a more repeatable game. These starting states are editable 
			in the startingPosAndVels array of the capture.<li>Command to 
			generate a new drone and navigation pin at the location of the local 
			cursor: depress the shift, d, and p 
			keys together (shift-d-p).</ul>
		<li>March, 2019<ul>
			<li>Added new variations of Puck Popper. Click on the #8 button, 
			then click on the letters in the "Plus" row under the button 
			cluster. Versions "d", and "e" have no drag force on the 
			host puck. "c" and "d" have elastic collisions (restitution of 1.0). 
			"e" applies no recoil when firing bullets and so it's good for 
			demonstrating the target-leading algorithm.<li>Now inhibiting collisions between the bullets, themselves, and their 
			host. This cleans up the game play somewhat and avoids an anomaly in 
			the physics engine when shooting at walls at very close range.<li>Code revisions:<ul>
				<li>Allow the host (local) puck to be treated (edited and 
				captured) separately from the pucks of the network clients. 
				Network client pucks are instantiated as copies of the host puck 
				if it is available.<li>Changed treatment of NPC (drone) pucks 
				that are taken off the navigation pins. The free-floating NPC 
				pucks are drawn without a jet tube or jet flame.</ul>
			<li>Holding the control key down, displays the 
			position and elasticity properties of a single selected puck.</ul>
		<li>December, 2018<ul>
			<li>The new "Friendly fire" checkbox (visible when the "Multiplayer" 
			control is checked) controls whether bullets from real Puck Popper 
			players can affect the health of other real players. If unchecked, 
			human bullets can only hit the drones. In this mode multiple players 
			act as a team to scrub out those nasty drones. Nice.</ul>
		<li>November, 2018<ul>
			<li>New parameters in the leaderboard records to better characterize 
			the various ways the games can be played.<li>Toggle link (at the end 
			of the title row for the report) for viewing the two leaderboard 
			tables (time and score), one at a time.<li>The "More" row beneath 
			the button cluster. For some demos, this row will contain links to 
			variations on the primary version of the demo.</ul>
		<li>September, 2018<ul>
			<li>Secured the site (https).</ul>
		<li>August, 2018<ul>
			<li>Changes in the code: <br />Revised the Spring class to include the functionality that was in 
			the client-cursor springs (originally called them cursor strings). 
			Springs can now be attached at off-center points on pucks (turn off 
			"Select COM" to establish off-center selection points). 
			Client-cursor springs are implemented using the revised Spring 
			class.</ul>
		<li>July, 2018<ul>
			<li>Leaderboard report: the top 15 scores get reported below the 
			game score table. The report consists of two query results, one 
			table sorted by score, the other by time. The backend of the 
			leaderboard, a Google sheet, is queried depending on the version of 
			the Puck Popper game (e.g. demo #7 results are reported separate 
			from #8). Custom versions of Puck Popper, made using the capture 
			feature, are reported separately as distinguished by a unique 
			identifier in the capture. Game results where the mouse was used (in 
			the Canvas area) or the drones are "sleeping", are filtered out of 
			the reports.<li>Editor features to adjust the surface-friction (+/- 
			keys) and drag (&lt;/&gt; keys) of 
			selected pucks.<li>Puck finder: the question-mark key 
			identifies your puck in demos #7 and #8.<li>Pinned-spring 
			constraints in demo #9 will gently return the three balls to the 
			triangle orientation. The hidden springs and pins are now visible if 
			the "Edit walls &amp; pins" feature is enabled.<li>A way to enter a 
			nickname without connecting to the multiplayer server. From the host 
			page, type the nickname into the chat field, 
			before starting demos #7 or #8. That nickname will be used when 
			reporting to the leaderboard.</ul>
		<li>June, 2018<ul>
			<li>Added scoring features to Puck Popper (demos 7 and 8):<ul>
				<li>+200 for last puck-player standing<li>+100 for popping 
				client and drone pucks<li>+50 for popping a regular puck<li>+10 for hitting a puck with one of your bullets<li>-10 for 
				getting hit by a bullet<li>-1 for shooting a bullet that expires 
				before it hits another puck</ul>
			<li>A score summary for each player is reported in the chat panel at 
			the end of the game (one puck left).</ul>
		<li>April, 2018<ul>
			<li>Puck popping sound effect.<li>Scope control: <br />Located in the bottom right corner of the virtual gamepad, this 
			control precisely rotates the pea shooter and shoots from a fixed 
			position. Touching the center block stops the movement of your puck, 
			and then shoots without recoil (and no rotation). The surrounding 
			two blocks rotate the shooter tube. The rotation rate is reduced as 
			the touch point approaches the center block.</ul>
		<li>March, 2018<ul>
			<li>Virtual gamepad:<br />The client interface has been extended to include support for 
			touch-screen devices. Yes, cell-phone play for Puck Popper, demos 7 
			and 8. This is accessed via the Two-Thumbs button on the client. 
			First, from your phone, connect a client page to the host, then 
			touch the Two-Thumbs button.<li>Full-screen button (bottom right):
			<br />Nice for viewing the demos with nothing but the animation canvas 
			visible. This works best in Chrome. Once in fullscreen mode, use 
			ctrl +/- to scale up or down. When hosting, this is the best way to 
			present a Puck Popper game to a group of viewers.
            <li>Prior to connecting, put a nickname is in the chat field.
			This helps to keep track of who's in a multiplayer Puck Popper game.</ul>
		<li>January, 2018<ul>
			<li><a href="https://triquence.org/?9">Demo #9</a>: additive color mixing<li>Option to put startup info in the URL (the query string). For 
			example: <a href="https://triquence.org/?7b">triquence.org/?7b</a> starts the b version of demo #7,
			<a href="https://triquence.org/?8">triquence.org/?8</a> 
			starts demo #8. This allows the user to post a link to a specific 
			demo. Related to this, improved the startup process: framerate is 
			sampled on a blank canvas for about one second.<li>Group copy and 
			paste with multi-select (ctrl-v replicates the selected group or 
			single object 
			to the cursor position). A spring-only paste is now done with 
			ctrl-s.<li>Drone copying. Copy operations directed at a drone puck 
			now replicate the drone client. The copy will simply float (not 
			navigate) unless you copy and paste a navigation spring from another 
			drone. See discussion under demo #7.</ul>
		<li>December, 2017<ul>
			<li>Moved most of the editor's rotation features to be part of 
			multi-select. Automated the editors use of the COM feature.<li>Use "o" key for single stepping and repeatedly (hold "o" key 
			down) slow stepping the animation (use "p" to resume normal 
			animation).<li>Option to model springs with soft constrains. This is 
			Erin Catto's spring modeling approach (distance joints) in Box2D. 
			Please refer to the discussion for demo #5.<li>Editing option for 
			modifying the spring-damping and puck-restitution coefficients: 
			select object, then use page-up or page-down keys.</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Group-rotation for the editor's multi-select (select multiple 
			objects, then hold control and shift key down, then mouse drag).</ul>
		<li>November, 2017<ul>
			<li>Run-it links in the demo topics (follow the more-on-the-demos link 
			on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>). The run-it links 
			automatically feed a capture to the engine and then run it.<li>Multi-body drag. Hold control key down, then click and drag to 
			move all bodies in the multi-select group.<li>Automatic setting of the engine's timestep.<li>Frame stepper (button) 
			when animation is paused.<li>Box selector for multi-select. Hold alt key down, then click and 
			drag.</ul>
		<li>October, 2017<ul>
			<li>P2P video stream from host to client (canvas to video element). This facilitates multiuser play outside the boundaries 
			of a single physical room.</ul>
		<li>September, 2017<ul>
			<li>WebRTC <a href="peer2peer.html" target="_blank">peer-to-peer</a> 
			(P2P) layer added to the socket.io functionality (note that shift-p 
			acts to toggle P2P on/off from the client page).</ul>
		<li>August, 2017<ul>
			<li>Ray-casting drones for demos #7 and #8<ul>
				<li>Guns lead (aim ahead) to compensate for target-object motion.
            	<li>Drone navigation forces render as jets.</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>July, 2017<ul>
			<li>Modified the spring object to allow for storage on two pins (see 
			demo #4).</ul>
		<li>June, 2017<ul>
			<li>Multi-object selection functionality for the editor<li>More 
			editor features for puck objects (resizing)<li>An example of a 
			<a href="demo6b.js.html">JSON 
			capture</a> of a modified version of demo #6</ul>
		<li>May, 2017<ul>
			<li>Some editor features now apply to 
			non-wall objects: drag pins, delete pins and pucks, change angle and 
			rotation rate for pucks.</ul>
		<li>April, 2017<ul>
			<li>A control for setting the physics-engine timestep. This supports 
			users running displays at higher (than 60hz) refresh rates.</ul>
		<li>March, 2017<ul>
			<li>Demo #8 introduces a basic wall editor and a capture feature to 
			build (and save) terrain for Puck Popper battles.
			<li>A tangle timer for demo #6 (Jello Madness). This coupled with 
			the capture feature makes for a playable game.<li>Sound-field 
			simulation for demo #2</ul>
		<li>February, 2017<ul>
			<li>Demo #7 brings in some game-feature objects: jets, guns, 
			shields, and health indicators. This is similar to the Puck Popper 
			game from the
			<a href="https://pet.triquence.org/">tutorial</a> page and helps 
	to demonstrate receiving keyboard events from the multiplayer clients.</ul>
		<li>January, 2017<ul>

		<li>March, 2016<ul>
			<li>Purchased timetocode.org from Google domains. This domain name 
			seemed about right for me and nicely represents the collision between 
			my retirement and my interest in coding. (note: in 2024 changed domains, from timetocode to 
			<a href="https://triquence.org">triquence</a>)</li>
			<li>Started hosting at 50webs and added two subdomains: 
			<ul>
				<li>pet</li>
				<li>waconia</li></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Moved the Physics Engine Tutorial (PET) content from gustavus.edu to the
		pet subdomain</li>
			<li>Moved my Waconia weather-gleaner and charting site to inside my 
		local network at home. The site was most recently hosted on my office 
		computer at Gustavus. Sorry, it's only for me now. It has 
		sentimental value as it was a starting point of sorts that got me going 
		as a developer at PNNL. In a sense I have archived it at 
			<a href="https://waconia.triquence.org">waconia</a>. Some
			<a href="https://waconia.triquence.org/charts.html">sample</a> charts from my local network get 
		pushed out there every hour. I even put together some
			<a href="https://waconia.triquence.org/Install_rosy.htm">installation</a> 
		instructions. It's a tricky install. Let me know if you get it up and 
		running on your local network.</li>
