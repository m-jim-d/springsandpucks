	page 
	now contains multiplayer functionality. The approach is to collect mouse and 
	keyboard events from the client device and deliver them to the host 
	computer. All rendering is done on the host's screen (everyone must be in one 
	physical room). Client mouse activity is detected when the cursor is over the blank canvas on the client's page.</p>
	<p>This is like a game-console experience: 
	social, multiple controllers, and with viewing on one screen. (As of October 
	of 2017, the clients have the option to request a video stream from the 
	host's canvas. This allows players to be outside the single physical room 
	mentioned here and yet still play the game that is running on the host's canvas.)</p>
	<p>The diagram here shows the overall dataflow from the network clients, to 
	the node server, to the client objects in the game module on the host 
	computer. Finally, the output of the physics engine is rendered to the HTML 
	5 Canvas and displayed on the host's monitor.</p>
	<p>A host that has a large monitor or projection screen is always nice. Note 
	you can host multiple rooms on one screen, side by side. Just open the demo 
	(host) page in another browser window and start a new "room" for that second 
	window.</p>
	<p>The best performance, lowest latency, comes with installing a local node 
	server on the host computer. The installation instructions are short (see section 
	below). This local-node approach is the configuration shown in the diagram. </p>
	<p>And if you're wondering about <a href="peer2peer.html">peer-to-peer</a> 
	connections and protocols like WebRTC, that will be introduced at the end of this page.</p>
	<p>The networking magic is contained mostly in two files for the node server:
	<a href="package.json.html" target="_blank">package.json</a> and
	<a href="server.js.html" target="_blank">server.js</a>, and one file for the host and client pages:
	<a href="hostAndClient.js.html" target="_blank">hostAndClient.js</a>.</p>
	<h2>A Quick How-To</h2>
	There's a remote node server running at Heroku. You can try this 
	multi-player stuff (without installing your own node server) by connecting to the 
	one at 
	Heroku. It goes like this:<ol>
		<li>From the <a href="index.html">demo</a> page, click the multi-player 
		checkbox (right side of the page).<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Type a short room name into the red input box (left side of the page).<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Optionally, type a nickname for yourself into the chat input box.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Click the "Create" button. (It can take up to 10 seconds to wake up the Heroku 
		application.) You should see a chat message from the server indicating 
		you are the host of that room.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Now open a client page in a new window. The easiest way to try this 
		out is to stay on one computer. But it's probably best to fire up the 
		laptop (or a second laptop) at this point and use it for the client 
		page. Use a link <a href="client.html">here</a> or the one below 
		the multi-player toggle (on the right side of the demo page).<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Type in the same room name (as in step 2 above) into the red box on this client page. 
		Optionally, type a nickname for this client in the chat field. 
      Now click the "Connect" button. You'll get connection confirmation in the chat panel. Also the server 
		field will be populated with the address of the Heroku node application.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>For a laptop or pc, move your mouse over the rectangular video element on the client 
		page. It will be blank or a live stream (see streaming option in step 8). You should see your mouse position rendered as a small colored 
		triangle 
		(your new cursor) on the host's canvas (and also in your client's video 
		element if streaming). Try each of the three mouse 
		buttons to get differing mouse-spring strength (middle button is the 
		weakest).<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>There are three additional connection options available from the 
		client page:<ul>
			<li>Each connected client may initiate a live video stream of the 
			host's canvas. After connecting, click the "Stream" checkbox on the 
			client. This works best if the host and the clients are running 
			their monitors at the same refresh rate. Overall, Chrome is best for 
			streaming. If the client has limited cpu power (like a Raspberry 
			Pi), the stream will be significantly delayed. Any client without a 
			video stream must have direct line of sight to the host's screen.<br>&nbsp;<br>
			<img alt="Two Thumbs" src="images/twoThumbs.png" style="max-width:60%; max-height:60% image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast; float:right"></li>
			<li>The Two-Thumbs touch screen interface, a virtual gamepad (see 
			image to the right), is 
			useful for controlling a game puck from a cell phone in demos 7 and 
			8 (Puck Popper). From your cell phone, or other touch-screen device, 
			open the client page in Chrome. Connect to the host as described 
			above, then click the "Two Thumbs" button. Your left thumb will 
			control the jet direction and intensity (more thrust the farther 
			your touch point is out from center dot). Right thumb fires and 
			aims the shooter. The center rectangle turns the shield on/off.<br>&nbsp;<br>The 
			colored rectangle, below the shield control, indicates your client 
			color. Touch it, and a large circle will show around your puck 
			(helping you to find it).<br>&nbsp;<br>The small rectangle controls 
			at the bottom require the alt rectangle to be touched first (this prevents accidental firing of these 
			controls when driving the puck). These can be used to: get out of 
			the full-screen mode (esc), freeze the object motion (f), restart 
			the two Puck Popper games (7 and 8).<br>&nbsp;<br>The scope control 
			is located in the bottom right corner of the virtual gamepad. This 
			control precisely rotates the shooter tube and shoots from a fixed 
			position. Touching the center block stops the movement of your puck, 
			and then shoots without recoil (and no rotation). The surrounding 
			two blocks, rotate the shooter tube (ccw or cw). The rotation rate 
			is reduced as the touch point approaches the center block.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Combine these options to support cell-phone play in a separate 
			physical room. That, of course, will require two client devices, a 
			cell phone for the virtual gamepad, and a laptop or pc for the 
			stream.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>There are "Full Screen" buttons on the host and client pages. These 
		put the animation canvas (or streaming video element) into full-screen 
		mode and give a nice front-and-center presentation of the action. My 
		favorite way to play Puck Popper is with the host in full-screen mode 
		and the client in Two-Thumbs mode. This all works best in Chrome. After 
		entering full-screen mode, the displayed element can be scaled up and 
		down with the ctrl +/- keys.<br></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Latency</h2>
	<p>
	The Heroku server is in California or on the East coast somewhere. Speed-of-light limitations 
	will be noticeable from the Midwest. You can measure the round-trip time 
	with the ping features in the node-server and client scripts. Type the word 
	"ping" into the chat field and then enter that or click the "chat" button. 
	Here is a screen shot of a test from Minnesota to the Heroku server.<p>
	<img alt="ping" src="images/ping1.png" />&nbsp;<p>
	And here is a ping test to a node server running on a computer (a Raspberry 
	Pi) on my local network.<p>
	<img alt="ping" height="90" src="images/ping2.png" width="536" /><p>
	It takes about 26% of the time (16ms compared to 61ms). You'll notice that 
	reduced latency especially with mouse movements. If you install the local 
	node server, as described below, you may also feel a more continuous, less 
	jumpy rendering (fewer dropped 
	packets).<p>
	If you enter "ping:host" in the chat field you'll get the time for a 
	round-trip time to the host and back (via the server). That's a four legged 
	path, client to server to host to server to client. Here's an example of 
	that type of ping where the client and host are on one computer and the node 
	server is at Heroku:<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="ping" src="images/ping3.png" /><p>
	That takes twice as long as the base test and is about what is expected for 
	a trip that's twice as far. This is the more rigorous test in that it 
	travels the actual path to the host. If you divide this number by two you 
	get the best estimate of the latency involved in our one-way communications 
	with the host.<h2>Installation of a Node Server</h2>
	<p>The following sections provide instructions for installing 
	and running a local node server on Windows and Linux, and a remote server on 
	the Linux environment at 
	Heroku. </p>
	<p>(Note that the local install offers the best performance if the node 
	server is put on the host computer. But that's not absolutely necessary. It 
	can go on any computer on your local network. I sometimes have several node 
	servers running at home and just point the 
	host and client pages at a particular server's IP address during testing.)</p>
	<p>(Update: January 25, 2021. Browsers are now requiring equal security 
	levels (https or http) for both the web server and node server. Therefore, to use a
	<strong>local</strong> http node server for local-network multiplayer game 
	play, now requires that the html pages be served locally as http. An 
	alternative approach is to change the local node server to serve on https, 
	thereby not conflicting with the https at triquence.org. Also note, to 
	simply test a local node server using http, have the host and client pages 
	use 
	https (triquence.org) while on the same computer as the node server; the node 
	server can then be referenced using localhost:3000 and yet avoid the 
	conflict.)</p>
	<h3>On Windows</h3>
	<p>Download the node installer for Windows
	<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/#download">here</a>. Run the installer.</p>
	<p>Download the node-server.zip file from
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxaBWklPKdjQWJaX0tNOVdMRms">here</a> 
	(this works best if you login to Google). 
	Unzip it and copy or move the three files (package.json, server.js, and 
	links.html) to a working directory where you wish to keep your node-server 
	content.</p>
	<p>Open a Windows command prompt and go to your working directory. Then 
	enter the following:</p>
	<p class="code">npm install</p>
	<p>Now start your node server by entering the following command (while still 
	in that working directory):</p>
	<p class="code">node server.js</p>
	<p>The first time you start the server you'll be asked for permission 
	to go through the firewall. Agree to this. You're now ready to connect to 
	your local server. Refer to the "After Installation" section below.</p>
	<h3>On Linux</h3>
	<p>First, install node.js on linux:</p>
	<p class="code">curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash 
	-<br />
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs</p>
	Download the node-server.zip file from
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxaBWklPKdjQWJaX0tNOVdMRms">here</a> 
	(this works best if you login to Google). 
	Unzip it and copy or move the three files (package.json, server.js, and 
	links.html) to a working directory where you wish to keep your node-server 
	content.<p>Then
	enter the following command (from that directory):</p>
	<p class="code">npm install</p>
	<p>Then run the node-server script (while still in that same directory).</p>
	<p class="code">node server.js</p>
	<p>You're now ready to connect to your local server. Refer to the "After 
	Installation" section below.</p>
	<h3>At Heroku</h3>
	<p>For many game situations a remote node server is just fine. The extra 
	latency won't be noticed especially if you're not controlling objects with 
	mouse movements. The same three files that are used for the local 
	installations can also be used at Heroku. Here's how:</p>
	<p>First, open an <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">account</a> at 
	Heroku.</p>
	<p>Download and Install the CLI (command line interface). Links to the 
	Windows 32 and 64bit installers are on
	<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">this page</a>.</p>
	<p>If you haven't already setup a working directory, download the 
	node-server.zip file from
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxaBWklPKdjQWJaX0tNOVdMRms">here</a> 
	(this works best if you login to Google). 
	Unzip it and copy or move the three files (package.json, server.js, and 
	links.html) to a working directory where you wish to keep your node-server 
	content.</p>
	<p>Open the CLI using the Git CMD&nbsp;icon. Then go to your 
	working directory (where you have the server.js, package.json, and 
	links.html files). The little screenshot below shows what that looked like 
	for me (I have a Git CMD icon on my desktop).</p>
	<p><img alt="heroku" src="images/heroku.jpg" /></p>
	<p>At that command prompt, login to heroku:</p>
	<p class="code"><span class="function" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
	heroku login</span></p>
	<p>Run these commands to initialize a local Git repository and commit your 
	files to it:</p>
	<p class="code">git init<br />
	git add .<br />
	git commit -am "another update"</p>
	<p>Run this command to create your new (blank) node application at Heroku:</p>
	<p class="code"><span class="function" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
	heroku create</span></p>
	<p>Finally, push your local code out to Heroku:</p>
	<p class="code">git push heroku master</p>
	<p>That should do it. Now you can run the following command to open a 
	browser and a little page being hosted by your node server. That page simply 
	has links to the host and client. Make note of the URL for that page (it will be something like 
	xxxxx-xxxxx-nnnnnn.herokuapp.com). That's the secret sauce you need to paste 
	into the "Server" input box on the host and client pages.</p>
	<p class="code">heroku open</p>
	<p>Updates to your Heroku application can be published by using these three 
	commands. I like to put these in a little batch file so it's easy to push out 
	changes.</p>
	<p class="code">git add .<br />
	git commit -am "another update"<br />
	git push heroku master</p>
	<h2>After Installation</h3>
	<p>The server.js script will activate all the socket.io event listeners that 
	are needed to receive input from the clients.</p>
	<p>Now you should able to point the host or client pages to the IP address 
	of the computer on which you installed the 
	node server. Do that by entering the node-server's IP address and port into the "Server" 
	input box on the host or client page (e.g. 192.168.1.106:3000). You can also see this in the screen 
	shots in the Latency section above. Then click the "Connect" button.</p>
	<p>For the Heroku server, use the URL of the page that opens up 
	after issuing the "heroku open" command. Copy everything after the "<strong>https://</strong>"; 
	it should be something like <strong>xxxxx-xxxxx-nnnnn.herokuapp.com</strong>. 
	Then paste that into the "Server" input box and click the "Connect" button.</p>
	<p>You can restart your local node server at any time from the command line 
	(in your working directory). Simply issue control-c twice. That 
	should bring you back to the normal command line prompt. Then to start it 
	again, just type "node server.js" as you did during the installation. After 
	a server restart you will need to reconnect the host and clients. Always 
	start with the host, then the clients.</p>


<h2>WebRTC</h2>
<p>WebRTC is a new technology that supports peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. It still 
requires an external server to be host to a signaling process in which the peer 
computers exchange credentials. Maybe the most compelling aspect about WebRTC is 
that you can use UDP (instead of TCP). That might offer better gaming 
performance especially with mouse movement. However, at this time it is 
significantly more complex for a developer to get WebRTC up and running. My 
target reader here is someone like a teacher that is working with a small group 
of students. And the local node server offers very good performance and is 
fairly straightforward to install. If you're developing a site similar to this 
one, you may want to stick with Node.js and socket.io for starters.</p>
	<p>Having said that, in September of 2017 I added a WebRTC (P2P) layer on 
	top of the socket.io approach described above. This exists, in the code, 
	mainly side-by-side with the socket.io functionality; by that I mean I don't 
	think it confuses the work described above. The WebRTC depends on socket.io 
	for use in the signaling process, but doesn't change the socket.io 
	implementation here. Here's a new <a href="peer2peer.html">page</a> that 
	discusses this. The ping-test result (below) is along the P2P connection to 
	the u21 client. Fast! Even a little faster than the local-node-server result 
	above.</p>
