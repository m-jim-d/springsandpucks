         </span>
         
         <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 20px 0px 20px -10px;">
            <li>Move objects (pucks) with your mouse or finger. Drag and fling them. Put on the breaks with the f key. 
            Try the g key.
            <br><br></li>
            
            <li>Click on the links in the row of letters (under the numbered buttons) to run the variations of the base demos. For example,
            click on the "5" button and then click on the "d" link to see the falling-dandelions demo.
            <br><br></li>

            <li>Button #7 starts the Puck Popper game. With multiple players, use #8 for more terrain. For more challenge, try 8c, 8d, and 8e.
            Here's a how-to <a title='How to play Puck Popper' href='https://youtu.be/ZAeRF1GOurA' target="_blank">video</a> on Puck Popper. 
            Try the Jello: #6.
            <br><br></li>
               
            <li>The <a href="#" onClick="window.open('client.html', '_blank', 'width=1240, height=750')" title="open a client page in a new window.">client</a> 
            interface for multiplayer includes a virtual gamepad for cell phones (or any touch-screen device). 
            Try it. Click the multiplayer option (right panel) to start hosting a game. 
            Type in a room name (left panel), and then click the "Create" button. On your cell phone, 
            from the <a href="#" onClick="window.open('client.html?m', '_blank', 'width=1240, height=750')" title="open a client page in a new window.">mini-client</a> page,
            enter the room name and then touch the "Connect" button. 
            After your connection to the host succeeds, touch the "Two-Thumbs" button.
            <br><br></li>
            
            <li>
            Play some <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(3, {'fileName':'demo3d.js'})">ghost-ball</a> pool. 
            Maybe even try some <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(4, {'fileName':'demo4e.monkeyhunt.js'})">hunting</a>.
            <br><br></li>
            
            <li>Try an editor feature: select a puck, then resize it with the arrow keys.
            <br><br></li>
            
            <li>Then save your edits by clicking the capture button. Replay the capture by clicking the corresponding number key or the "run" button.
            <br><br></li>
            
            <li>With the "Ctrl" and "Shift" keys down, use the left/right arrow keys to step through the history of 
            page links that have been clicked (the up-arrow key jumps to the top of the page).</li>
         </ul>

         <span id="buttonsHelp"></span>
         Use the <strong>number buttons</strong> in the right 
         panel to start demos and games. To restart, click the 
         button again (or use the corresponding number key on the keyboard). 
         The letter links, below the number buttons,
         start variations of the base demo or game. 
         <details class="onIndex">
         <summary title="click for more on the buttons">details...</summary>
         Clicking one of these letter links populates the capture box and starts the variation. 
         Clicking the corresponding number button restarts the variation. 
         The "a" link acts to clear out the capture box and then restart the base demo. 
         The "0" (zero) key resets the demos, clears the capture, exits from full-screen mode, and scrolls this panel to the top.
         Each number button auto-scrolls this left panel to show corresponding information. 
         <br>
         The scrolling in the left panel is recorded. These panel-scroll positions can be revisited using the left and right
         arrow keys if both the "Ctrl" and "Shift" keys are held down. Similarly, the up-arrow key scrolls this panel to the top. 
         </details>
         <br>
         
         The "<strong>Freeze</strong>" button momentarily stops all puck translation while 
         allowing rotation to continue. The neighboring "<strong>R</strong>" button stops all 
         rotation (use t and shift-t to change the rotation rate of a selected puck).
         <br>&nbsp;<br>
         
         The "<strong>Reverse</strong>" button (or Ctrl-Backspace) flips the velocity and reverses the rotation rate of each puck. 
         <br>&nbsp;<br>
         
         Each of the <strong>three mouse buttons</strong> has a different spring strength 
         for dragging objects: left click for the normal spring, center 
         click for the weakest spring, right click for the strongest spring and a firmer connection 
         to the larger pucks.
         <details class="onIndex">
         <summary title="click for more on the mouse buttons">details...</summary>
         Note that using the right mouse button on the smallest 
         pucks may cause instability in the physics engine; go ahead and try it. If you're only

         Most controls have a <strong>keyboard shortcut</strong> letter underlined in their label. 
         <br>&nbsp;<br>
         
         The "<strong>COM</strong>" (Center Of Mass) checkbox controls the position of the selection point (and where the cursor spring attaches). 
         With this on, the selection point will always be at the center of the target object. 
         Turning this off allows you to apply an off-center force (torque) to spin or stop spinning the object. 
         <details class="onIndex">
         <summary title="click for more on the COM control">details...</summary>
         The "c" key is a keyboard shortcut for the COM checkbox. 
         Use alt-c to center the cursor-spring attachment point along the narrowest dimension of a rectangular puck. 
         Issuing alt-c a second time pushes the attachment point to the nearest end of the puck 
         (these alt-c commands apply to both single and multi-select).

         The "<strong>g</strong>" checkbox (or "g" key) toggles gravity between 0 and 9.8.
         <details class="onIndex">
         <summary title="click for more on gravity">details...</summary>
         The gravity checkbox also controls several associated parameters in
         <a href="https://github.com/hecht-software/box2dweb" target="_blank">Box2D</a>: restitution, friction, and 
         b2_velocityThreshold. Depending on the demo, if gravity is 
         turned off, these settings are used to produce more elastic 
         collisions (low energy loss) so things keep moving and don't 
         stick to the walls. In demo #6, the opposite is done so that 
         collisions are inelastic, reducing chatter when pucks are 
         held in contact with each other under the tension of springs. Note that if you use
         the editor to change the restitution or friction of a puck (or if the corresponding "fixed" flag has been set in the
         capture), it will remain fixed at that level, independent
         of the gravity checkbox, until the demo is reloaded or the puck is edited again. If you grab a puck
         with the control key down, you may see the word "fixed" after the restitution or friction values in
         the puck report.

         The "<strong>CV</strong>" checkbox put a Coronavirus costume on each of the drone pucks in the 
         Puck Popper game, demos 7 and 8. This gives you a safe way to take a swing at this nasty little
         virus.
         <br>&nbsp;<br>
         
         The "<strong>pause</strong>" checkbox disables all updates to the canvas. When paused,
         a stepper button is revealed in place of the fps value; click it to advance a single frame.
         If the perimeter walls are red, the animation is paused. Uncheck the "pause" control to
         resume animation. Alternatively use the "p" key to pause and resume. The neighboring "o" key
         will single step the animation. Hold the "o" key down to repeatedly step at a slow rate. 
         <br><br>
         
         The combination of the "<strong>alt</strong>" and "<strong>p</strong>" keys toggles the <strong>canvas 
         eraser</strong>. 
         <details class="onIndex">
         <summary title="click for more on the inhibiting the eraser">details...</summary>
         The eraser normally precedes each frame. When 
         toggled off, some drawing features, such as for springs, are inhibited. 
         This feature produces interesting variation of the demos, especially the 
         spinning rectangles of the 
         <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(4, {'fileName':'demo4d.js'})">#4d</a>
         group (turn gravity off, use the

         full-canvas button, and then alt-p), and the expanding color tail of 
         <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(2, {'fileName':'demo2e.js'})">#2e</a> 
         (again, use the full-canvas button, 
         grab the puck with the mouse, shrink it 
         all the way down using the arrow keys, fling it hard, 
         and then alt-p).

         <p style="margin-top: 2px;">
         The <i class="material-icons" style="font-size:30px; position:relative; top:9px; left:0px; margin: 0px -3px;">fullscreen</i> 
         full-screen button stretches the 
         animation canvas into full-screen mode while preserving the original aspect ratio. 
         This provides a nice front-and-center 
         presentation of the demos (a good way to play Puck Popper). 
         </p>

         full-canvas button enlarges the 
         canvas to match the size and aspect ratio of the screen (view port). When using this 
         feature, the perimeter fence is enlarged to match the dimensions of the 
         larger canvas (note: the fence is not adjusted for the pool games). 
         </p>
         
         <p style="margin-top: -5px;">
         Use either the "esc" key or the "0" key to exit from either of the full-screen views. Note

         The "<strong>remove/add items</strong>" select control, provides a way to scrub off the canvas and add elements as needed. If the cursor is moved off an option and onto
         the canvas (before clicking it) the cursor position can be used to position the new element; after positioning the cursor, press the enter key. If the option is 
         clicked, a default position on the canvas is used. 
         <br><br>
         The "<strong>align-selected</strong>" option under "remove/add items" acts to position (equally spaced) all the selected objects along a line formed by the two most separated members.
         It also linearizes the values of restitution, friction, and linear and angular damping based on the corresponding values of the two outer members. The keyboard shortcut is alt-L.
         <br><br>
         Similarly, the "<strong>arc-selected</strong>" option acts to position (equally spaced) the selected pucks along an arc (a semi-circle). The ordering of placement is in
         the same order as individual pucks are selected. So, for a trick-shot rack in a game of 9-ball, select the 1 ball first and the 9 ball last. This sets up a potential chain reaction
         of collisions, sending the 9-ball into a pocket.
         The keyboard shortcut is alt-shift-L.

         <span id="multi">Use the "<strong>Multiplayer</strong>" checkbox to display the 
         controls for connecting as a host to the node server. Then type a short 
         room name into the red input box (on the left). Optionally, type a 
         nickname for yourself into the chat input box. Then click the "create" button. Wait a 
         few seconds for the server to wake up. Open one (or several) client 
         windows from these links: 
         <a href="#" onClick="window.open('client.html', '_blank', 'width=1240,height=750')">window</a>, 
         <a href="client.html" target='_blank'>tab</a>. 
         From those client pages, repeat the connection 
         process using the same room name that you specified as the host. Once 
         connected, you will see your mouse and keyboard events rendering to the 
         host canvas (this page). That way multiple users can simultaneously 
         interact with the animated objects in the demo. 
         The question-mark key can be useful for locating your puck in the Puck Popper game (demos 7 and 8).
         There's more info on the 
         specifics of multiplayer game play in the topics for 
         <a class="scroll-link" href="#" title="" data-scroll-target="d7">demos #7</a> and #8 below.</span>
         <br><br> 
         
         Optionally, each connected client may initiate a live <strong>video 
         stream</strong> of the host's canvas. After connecting, click the 
         "Stream" checkbox on the client. This works best if the host and the 
         clients are running their monitors at the same refresh rate. Overall, 
         Chrome is the best browser for producing smooth rendering of the stream 
         on the client. If the client has limited cpu power (like a Raspberry 
         Pi), it's best not to stream. Any client without a video stream has to 
         be in the same physical room to see the rendering on the host's screen.

         <span id="twoThumbs">The <strong>Two-Thumbs</strong> touch screen interface, a virtual 
         gamepad (see image below), is useful for controlling a game puck from a 
         cell phone in demos 7 and 8 (Puck Popper). From your cell phone, or 
         other touch-screen device, open the <a href="client.html?m" target="_blank">mini-client</a> page in Chrome (or the <a href="client.html" target="_blank">full client</a>). 
         Connect to the host as described above, then click the "Two Thumbs" button. Your 
         left thumb will control the jet direction and intensity (more thrust the 
         farther your touch point is out from center dot). Right thumb fires and 
         aims the shooter. The center rectangle turns the shield on/off.</span>
         <br><br>
         <!-- image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast optimizeQuality crisp-edges -->
         <img title="screen shot of the Two-Thumbs touch-screen interface" src="images/twoThumbs_small.png" width="513" height="316">
         <br><br>          
         The colored rectangle, below the shield control, indicates your client color. Touch 
         it, and a large circle will show around your puck (helping you to find 
         it). The small rectangle controls at the bottom require the alt 
         rectangle to be touched first (this prevents accidental firing 
         of these controls when driving the puck). These can be used to: get out 
         of the full-screen mode (esc), freeze the object motion (f), restart the 
         two Puck Popper games (7 and 8). 
         The scope control is located in the bottom right corner of the virtual 
         gamepad. This control precisely rotates the shooter tube and shoots from 
         a fixed position. Touching the center block stops the movement of your 
         puck, and then shoots without recoil (and no rotation). The surrounding 
         two blocks, rotate the shooter tube (ccw or cw). The rotation rate is 
         reduced as the touch point approaches the center block. 
         <br><br>
         
         Note that you can use the Two-Thumbs interface, even when
         there is no direct line of sight to the host's screen, by starting up a second client with a video stream.
         <br><br>
         
         As described above, the full-screen buttons 
         provide means for presenting the canvas without the help/chat and the controls panels (nice for playing
         Puck Popper).

         <span id="capture">The "<strong>Capture</strong>" button (or "u" key) records the current state of 
         a demo. The result is written to the neighboring text cell and also to 
         the paste buffer. The capture can be started with the "<strong>Run</strong>" button (or shift-r from keyboard) or the corresponding
         number button (highlighted yellow). Restart with "Run" or the yellow demo button.</span>
         <br><br>
         After capturing, the results can be saved for later use by pasting into 
         a text file. To reanimate the capture, paste the result back into the 
         capture text area and click the "Run" button or the corresponding demo button. 
         The capture result is in formatted JSON. Code editors work well to view 
         and edit the capture with syntax highlighting (JavaScript).
         <br><br> 
         A capture can be immediately taken after starting a demo (before the engine alters the state) by clicking the "Run" button
         while holding the shift key down. This can be used to get an updated copy of an existing capture. This is also a good way to
         take an un-altered (0th frame) capture of the "a" versions of the demos.
         <br><br> 
         There are links to color-highlighted examples of JSON captures in the help topic for <a class="scroll-link" href="#" title="" data-scroll-target="d6">demo #6</a>. 
         These were taken following use of the editing features (see below) to 
         make two circular structures from the Jello matrix.
         <br><br>
         Captures can be edited. To try it, first, to better view the capture, right-click in the capture text area (or drag out the lower right corner). 
         Run the 2c demo, and then change one of the pucks so that its tail's rainbow parameter is set to "true".
         Then start it with the "Run" or #2 buttons.

         The "remove/add items" select control has two procedures for modifying an existing capture: "shift capture" and "modify capture."
         For both of these, you'll need to start with a capture in the capture text area.

         Altering the characteristics of objects in a multi-select group, such as

         it indicates the changing value of the last object selected in the group. All

            <li><strong>springs</strong>: ctrl-x applies to springs on pucks/pins in the multiselect

               </ul>
            </li>   
            <li><strong>revolute joints</strong>: ctrl-x applies to revolute joints on pucks/pins/walls in the multiselect

               </ul>
            </li>  
         </ul>
         Copy and paste can be used to place a spring onto a pair of selected pucks or pins: 
         <ol>
            <li>use multi-select to select ONE spring (two pucks/pins)</li>
            <li>copy it (ctrl-c)</li>
            <li>use multi-select to select a new pair of pucks/pins (turn off "Select COM" to select off-center points)</li>
            <li>paste the spring (ctrl-s)</li>
         </ol>
         <br>
         A few things to try with multi-select:

            <li>Dissect (or add to) the jello matrix in demos #6 and #8.</li>
            <li>Select a compound object (like the triangle in demo #5) and change the connecting spring lengths while it's spinning.</li>

         The <a onclick="cR.clearState();dS.demoStart(1)">1a</a> version is a simple mix of large and small pucks, no gravity. These pucks have some surface friction,
         tackiness, affecting collision and rotational behavior. If gravity is toggled on, their tacky surface, allows 
         these to be combined (stacked) into rolling trios. Try toggling off the "COM" (center of mass) selection and then
         mouse drag to apply a torque to one of these pucks. Surface friction of selected pucks can be changed via the editor (+,- keys).

         the <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(1, {'fileName':'demo1b.10ms.js'})">10ms</a> version will yield a similar result.

         For a little side trip with 1b, try setting the surface friction to zero for all the pucks.

         <span id="d1_pi"></span><a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(1, {'fileName':'demo1c.js'})">1c</a> presents an unusual method for
         calculating the first two digits of pi (31) using two elastically colliding pucks. 
         Wait as the large puck is repelled by collisions with the smaller puck (and wall). The
         collision count will stop, eventually, as the two pucks both move in the negative y direction, 
         the large puck slightly faster than the smaller one.
         This 31-count case occurs when the larger puck has 100 times the mass of the smaller. 
         If the mass of the two pucks are changed to be equal (you can try this by editing the capture), this
         demo will yield the first digit of pi (3), three collisions, two kisses and one wall bounce. 
         <br><br>
         This 3Blue1Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE" target="_blank">video</a> tells the counting-to-pi story.
         <br><br>
         More pi digits can be found in this way at higher mass ratios, where the ratio is 100
         to some power of n. You'll need to use a dedicated 1D physics engine like
         <a href="https://pet.triquence.org/?countpi" target="_blank">this one</a> written in Python.
         The 1D algorithm is also implemented here in demos
         <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(1, {'fileName':'demo1d.js'})">1d</a> (3 digits of pi, n=2) and 
         <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(1, {'fileName':'demo1e.js'})">1e</a> (5 digits, n=4).
         <br><br>
         The "v max" value captures the highest velocity for the smaller puck during the pi-counting series. This peaks at the point
         when the larger puck has transfered all its kinetic energy to the smaller puck and reverses its direction. A closed-form solution
         to this can be derived by equating the kinetic-energy expressions for the two pucks. For 1e:

         two of the pucks are emitting at 60Hz (or the refresh rate of your 
         computer and monitor). The width of the canvas represents 6 meters. 
         Every second a single wave is colored white (contrasting) so you can 
         see that waves are propagating out from the puck. The propagation speed 
         can be changed in the capture (propSpeed_ppf_px). The set of waves are 
         stored in a FIFO buffer. The set size can be changed in the capture 
         (length_limit). This gives the appearance of a tail as the puck is 
         dragged. If you fling the puck so it moves faster than the wave speed (Mach > 1) 
         you will see a shock-wave.</span>

         Traditional spring models are not native to Box2D 
         and are developed here as external objects that apply forces to things 
         modeled in Box2D.
         Erin Catto uses a <strong>soft-constraints</strong> approach to spring modeling (<strong>distance joints</strong>) in Box2D. Here is his 
         <!-- https://box2d.org/files/GDC2011/GDC2011_Catto_Erin_Soft_Constraints.pdf -->
         <a href="GDC2011_Catto_Erin_Soft_Constraints.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a> on this.
         When using distance joints, I use the equations on page 45 to translate from <i>k</i> and <i>c</i> to frequency and damping ratio.
         (see updateB2D_spring method of the Spring prototype in the constructorsAndPrototypes module).
         <br><br>         
         Demo <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(5, {'fileName':'demo5a.soft.js'})">5a.soft</a> contrasts these two spring types: 
         traditional springs (yellow) on the left, and distance joints (cyan) on the right.
         The springs, in the first three rows, have decreasing damping as you work down from the top. The third row has no damping and the difference between
         the traditional spring and distance joint is most apparent there.         
         <br><br>         
         Most of the springs at triquence.org, including the cursor spring, 
         use a default spring-nature setting as they are being instantiated (e.g. when re-animating a capture, pasting a copy of a spring, 
         or adding a spring using the "remove/add items" select control). 
         Use <strong>shift-s</strong> to toggle this default setting between a distance joint (soft-constraints) or a traditional spring (Hooke's law). 
         After changing the default, you can then (you must) re-run a demo, or paste the new spring, to see the change in behavior.
         <br><br>
         Any spring having a softConstraints key specified in the capture, will override attempts to
         use the shift-s feature. You must remove the softConstraints key (edit the capture) to let the spring have a variable nature and respond to
         the shift-s command. Generally, any new capture will have a softConstraints key specified for each spring. 
         Note that an alternative to manually editing the capture is to use the <strong>shift-alt-s</strong> command. 
         This will remove the softConstraints keys for all springs in the live spring map. 
         Then immediately take a capture.
         <br><br>
         The capture for <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(5, {'fileName':'demo5a.soft.js'})">5a.soft</a>
         explicitly specifies the spring nature (see "softConstraints" key, set true or false, in the <a href="demo5a.soft.js.html" target="_blank">capture</a>). So, in this case, soft
         will stay soft, traditional will stay traditional.
         <br><br>
         The capture for <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(5, {'fileName':'demo5a.twinkle.js'})">5a.twinkle</a>
         is another example with softConstraint keys on the springs. If you use the <strong>shift-alt-s</strong> command, while the
         demo is playing at 60Hz, you'll see the legs start to dance (instability from Hooke's-law springs).
         <br><br>
         The advantage of the soft constraints is added
         stability: strong spring (or strong damping) forces on small masses will be more stable. 
         But the improvement in stability is small (as implemented here),
         and it seems that the traditional springs give a better (firmer) feel, especially in compound groups.
         Also, the distance joint will always lose some energy in trade for stability, even with a damping coefficient of zero.
         So I continue, for now, to leave the default set to traditional springs, and most of the 
         springs in the demos without a softConstraints key.

         The <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(5, {'fileName':'demo5h.4b1m.js'})">one-ball-moving</a> variation of this cradle can be made with

         <span id="d6"><strong>Demo #6a</strong>, <strong><a onclick="cR.clearState();dS.demoStart(6)">Jello-Madness</a></strong>, 
         is based on the corresponding <a href="https://pet.triquence.org/?jello" target="_blank">game</a> from the J-term course. 
         The demo starts with a mildly tangled block 
         of jello, it's spinning, and the tangle-timer is running. Straighten out the block 
         and the tangle timer stops. The idea here is to severely tangle up 
         the block for a game (drag perimeter pucks into the middle using the 
         right mouse button). Use the capture button to record a good tangle. 
         Then pass the mouse and keyboard to your friend and see if they can 
         untangle the mess; they start by clicking the #6 button (or 
         6 key). The shortest untangle time wins. The right mouse button, the freeze 
         control (f key), and possibly the gravity control are useful in this 
         game. Hints: one of the interior pucks is colored differently and also 
         note the diagonal springs are all yellow.</span>

         The w-a-s-d group of keys controls the jet that is used to move your puck.  
         The "w" key fires the jet. 
         The "a" and "d" keys rotate the jet clockwise and counterclockwise. 
         The "s" key is used to turn the jet to a direction opposing the current motion of the puck. 
         This can be useful in breaking (stopping). Subsequent "s" presses rotate 
         the jet in 90-degree clockwise steps. Firing the jet, "w", resets this pattern so the flip 
         operation results with the next "s" press.
         <br><br>
         The i-j-k-l group of keys controls your gun.
         The "i" key shoots bullets. 
         The "j" and "l" keys rotate the gun clockwise and counterclockwise. 
         The "k" key rotates the gun in 90-degree clockwise steps 
         (shift-k steps counterclockwise).
         <br><br>
         Holding down the spacebar turns on a 
         shield that protects you from the bullets of an opponent (you can't 
         shoot when your shield is up). Target pucks will pop after 10 hits, 
         client-controlled pucks pop after 20 hits.
         <br><br>
         The "friendly fire" checkbox (visible when the "Multiplayer" control is 
         checked) controls whether bullets from real Puck Popper players can 
         affect the health of other real players. If unchecked, human bullets can 
         only impact the drones. In this mode multiple players act as a team to 
         scrub out those nasty drones. Nice.
         <br><br>
         The blue pucks are drones. They try to get you (it's time to start 
         using the spacebar to turn your puck shields on). The drones follow a 
         path established by the blue pins. Turn on the editor to see the 
         navigation path. When the editor is on, you can drag these navigation 
         pins to change the drone path. These pins can also be copied and deleted 
         using the features of the editor. 
         <br><br>
         The multi-select features of the editor can be used to detach the drone 
         from the navigation path (delete its spring). First, check that 
         wall and pin edits are enabled. Box selection (click and drag with the alt key down) is useful for selecting the spring 
         between the drone and the navigation pin. If you've used the ctrl-q 
         feature to disable (sleep) the drone's movement and shooting, it will come 
         to rest over its current pin, making it hard to select both pin and 
         drone using the shift-key approach. The box selection method allows pin, 
         drone, and spring to be selected in one action, the box drag. Then 
         ctrl-x deletes the navigation spring. 
         <br><br>
         In a similar way, you can reattach a drone by copying (ctrl-c) the 
         spring from another drone and pasting (ctrl-s) it onto the free drone and a 
         blue navigation pin. Remember, ctrl-q toggles drone shooting and navigation on/off, useful
         when detaching and reattaching them.
         <br><br>
         Drones can be copied, to produce a free floating drone: mouse-drag over a drone, then ctrl-v. Attach it
         to the navigation path using the methods above.
         <br><br>
         A single drone, attached to a navigation pin, can be generated by 
         depressing the shift, d, and p keys together (shift-d-p). The drone and 
         pin will appear at the current location of the local host's cursor. If 
         wall/pin edits are enabled, you can then extend this drone's navigation 
         course by copying and dragging the pin (single-select operation, ctrl-v). 
         <br><br>
         Navigation forces are rendered as jets when
         the editor is off (rendered as springs when the editor is on).
         <br><br>
         The drones use raycasting to find puck targets. To hide from the ray, move behind a
         wall, behind another puck, or beyond the length of the ray.
         <br><br>
         After finding a puck, they point their 
         gun to "lead" the target. This anticipates where the moving-target 
         puck will be when the bullets arrive. You'll see the gun is angled slightly ahead
         of the raycast line when the target is moving. The algorithm also accounts for the motion
         of the drone.

         The controlled pucks are 
         inelastic and with some drag to make them a bit easier to drive (bullets and regular pucks are elastic and with no drag).

         Scoring in Puck Popper (demos 7 and 8):
         <ul>
            <li>+200 for last puck-player standing</li>
            <li>+100 for popping client and drone pucks</li>
            <li>+50 for popping a regular puck</li>
            <li>+10 for hitting a puck with one of your bullets</li>
            <li>-10 for getting hit by a bullet</li>
            <li>-1 for shooting a bullet that expires before it hits another puck</li>
         </ul>
         A score summary for each player is reported in the chat panel at the end of the game (one puck left).
         <br><br>
         A leaderboard report, the top 20 scores, is displayed below the game-score summary 
         table. The report consists of two query results, one table sorted by 
         time, the other by score (click the link to toggle between the two tables). 
         The backend of the leaderboard, a Google 
         sheet, is queried depending on the version of the Puck Popper game (e.g. 
         demo #7 results are reported separate from #8). Custom versions of Puck 
         Popper, made using the capture feature, are reported separately as 
         distinguished by a unique identifier in the capture. Game results where 
         the mouse was used (in the Canvas area) or the drones are "sleeping", 
         are filtered out of the reports.
         <br><br>
         From the host page, you can establish a nickname (without connecting to the multiplayer server) by typing
         the nickname into the chat field before starting demos #7 or #8. That nickname will be used
         when reporting to the leaderboard.

         <span id="d8"><strong>Demo #8a</strong> is a larger version of the <strong><a onclick="cR.clearState();dS.demoStart(8)">Puck Popper</a></strong> game. This is similar to #7 in that a controlled puck is created for

         the drones refer to <a class="scroll-link" href="#" title="" data-scroll-target="d7">demo #7</a>.

         To play without drones, use ctrl-q to stop the drone navigation. Use the editor features to select and delete them. Then capture
         the drone-free course for repeated play.
         <br><br>
         The starting position and velocity for each human-controlled puck is fixed (to be the same each time the game starts).
         These positions can be edited in the startingPosAndVels object of a capture.
         <br><br>
         <a onclick="cR.clearState();dS.demoStart(8)">8a</a> is intended to be a template that can be <a class="scroll-link" href="#" title="" data-scroll-target="editorMark">edited</a> and captured for later use.
         <br><br>
         Try shooting at the pucks in the spring matrix (jello).
         The editor's multi-select feature is useful for carving/slicing up the jello. Hold the shift key down, then mouse over pucks in the jello grid.
         A first ctrl-x will delete selected springs, a second ctrl-x will delete the selected pucks.

         the controlled pucks are inelastic and with some drag to make them a bit easier to drive. 
         Bullets are elastic and with no drag; regular pucks are inelastic and with no drag.
         <br><br>

         These versions of Puck Popper are the most challenging to play. 
         This optimizes the capability of the drone pucks to anticipate (and lead) for the motion of the human-controlled pucks. 
         <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(8, {'fileName':'demo8e.js'})">8e</a> has no gun recoil.

         <span id="d9"><strong>Demo #9</strong> <a onclick="cR.clearState();dS.demoStart(9)">9a</a> animates the additive mixing of three colors: red, green, and blue. 
         The blending features of the HTML5 canvas facilitate the color mixing. The globalCompositeOperation attribute is set to a value of 'screen'.</span> 
         <br><br>
         The three balls are coupled together with three distance 
         joints (aka springs, with damping). Each ball is also lightly coupled 
         to a corresponding stationary pin and has some linear damping (fluid drag).             
         When "Edit walls & pins" feature is enabled (checked), the pins and 
         springs are visible.
         <br><br>
         Puck-puck collisions are 
         inhibited by using the collideConnected attribute of the distance joint. 
         If pucks are copied, they will collide with any pucks not coupled to 
         them with a distance joint.
         <br><br>
         Normal editing and capture features apply here. Use the box-selection 
         feature (alt key) for an easy way to copy or modify the three-puck 
         group. To include the pins in copy operations, the "Edit walls & pins" 
         feature must be enabled. The <a onclick="cR.demoStart_fromCapture(9, {'fileName':'demo9b.js'})">9b</a> version was made with the editor.
         <br><br>
         This demo runs most efficiently in Google Chrome. Frame rates will dip below
         target for other browsers, especially if the "Edit walls & pins" 
         feature is enabled.
         <br>&nbsp;
         
         <br><hr><br>
         <span id="EpLReport"></span>
         EpL is short for Energy, Momentum, and Angular Momentum. On a few of the demos, a realtime table is displayed in the canvas, 
         overlaying the animation. Toggle this report on/off with ctrl-L. Toggle between the EpL report and the Speed report with ctrl-alt-L
         (see EpL options in the "remove/add items" menu).
         All values are in SI units.         
         <br><br>
         Near the top of the <strong>EpL</strong> report, a row of system totals are given (cyan). Above that, grand totals are shown for E and L, aggregations of the parts: 
         <div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px;">
         E = PE + KEt + KEr<br>
         L = Lo + Ls
         </div>
         <br>
         There is a row for each puck and spring. Starting with the object's name (e.g. p1 for puck1), the remaining columns are:
         <div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px;">
         PE: potential energy (joules)<br>
         KEt: kinetic energy from translation (joules)<br>
         KEr: kinetic energy from rotation (joules)<br>
         Lo: orbital angular momentum, \( L_{o} =m(\vec{r}\times\vec{v}) \) (kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec)<br>
         Ls: spin angular momentum (kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec)<br>
         Px: x component of linear momentum (kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec)<br>
         Py: y component of linear momentum (kg-m<sup>2</sup>/sec)
         </div>
         <br>
         Orbital angular momentum is calculated about the axis marked with a circle (cyan) and cross-hairs. This is often at the system center of mass, but can be cursor dragged
         to new positions. Use the "E" key to enable pin editing, then drag with the ctrl key down. 
         Also note the "EpL axis at SCM" option in the "remove/add items" menu. This acts to position the EpL axis at the system center of mass.
         <br><br>
         The <strong>Speed</strong> report gives puck speeds and spring lengths (ctrl-alt-L):
         <div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px;">
         Speed: translational (meters/sec)<br>
         Radius: orbit radius (meters)<br>
         Orbit: orbital speed about specified axis, \( \Omega =\vec{r}\times\vec{v}/r^{2} \) (radians/sec) <br>
         Spin: rotational speed about the pucks center of mass (radians/sec)<br>
         Length: un-stretched spring length (meters)<br>
         Stretch: stretch [positive] or compression [negative] (meters)<br>
         Total: end-to-end length including stretch (meters)<br>
         </div>
         <br>
         As stated in its documentation, "Box2D uses the symplectic Euler integration scheme. 
         It does not reproduce parabolic motion of projectiles and has only first-order accuracy."
         This affects speed and kinetic energy predictions. As a result, you may see some variation in energy totals where a constant total is expect. 
         This mainly occurs when a puck is strongly accelerated by springs, lesser so with gravity.
         <br>
         <br><hr><br>
         <span id="frameRate"></span>These demos try to run at a <strong>frame rate</strong> that is equal to the refresh rate of your display.
         This frame rate is reported to the right of the "pause" control. The 
         value should be about 60fps if your display's refresh rate is set to 60 
         Hertz. Cell phones will generally not be able to reach 60fps for most of 
         the demos.
         <br><br> 
         
         Below the "pause" control is a selection control used in establishing a 
         fixed timestep for the physics-engine (inversely related to framerate).
         This is automatically set (based on an observation of your framerate) whenever 
         the page is refreshed.
         <br><br> 
         
         Generally this will get set 
         to 60 Hertz unless you have a DVI or Display Port connection to a 
         monitor that can render at higher rates. Note that the longer timestep of the 30 
         Hertz setting will be unstable in demos that 
         incorporate springs.<br><br>
         
         Direct mouse drag (and rotation) of single or multiple objects will produce instability when
         editing spring systems at rates of 60 Hz or less. At 100 Hz or higher these operations work
         the best.
         <br><br>
         
         If you do have high-refresh-rate gear, 
         try setting your monitor to a refresh rate that the demos can easily 
         match. If a demo is running slower (fps) than your monitor's refresh 
         rate, try reducing your monitor's rate (in Windows 10, right click on 
         the desktop, then "display setting", then "advanced display setting", 
         then "display adapter properties", then "monitor" tab, then change the 
         "screen refresh rate"). Then, after you have dialed back your monitor to the point that
         the demos can match it, set the timestep control to agree with that value (or refresh the
         page to set it automatically).<br><br> 
         
         At the beginning of the timestep select list, you'll 
         see the option "variable". This lets the physics timestep (framerate) 
         float along with the refresh rate of your monitor. This can be handy for 
         observing the fps performance of your system. 
         Generally it's best to only use this to test. Then set a similar fixed-timestep value.

         <span id="browsers">Overall, Chrome is the best <strong>browser</strong> to use here. (You may want to stop 
         reading about browsers and simply use Chrome.) However, Firefox is a 
         close second to Chrome, and, depending on the hardware, I sometimes 
         prefer its rendering e.g., demo #2 when running on my laptop.</span> 
         <br><br>
         Firefox has a "feature" that conflicts slightly with one of the editing 
         features here. Right-clicking with the shift key down will always bring 
         up a context menu in Firefox when the click is released, apparently 
         overriding attempts to disable it. Chrome and Edge do a better job 
         listening.
         <br><br>
         Firefox also has distinctive alt key behaviors. The alt key is used 
         here to start a box-based selection. If this is played by the book (hold 
         alt key down, then click and drag the mouse) all goes well. But if you 
         tap the alt key (down then release) this will trigger the menu bar to be 
         displayed. Any click and drag operations that follow will appear to be 
         stuck in box-select mode. To reset this do two complete cycles of the 
         alt key (down-up-down-up) without any mouse clicks in the middle.
         <br><br>
         Microsoft Edge is now based on Chromium (like Chrome). It works very
         well here, pretty much identical to Chrome.
         <br><br>
         MS Internet Explorer is not functional here.
         <br><br>
         Testing is very thin on macOS. Chrome looks good there; all the 
         multiplayer functionality (including WebRTC) works. Safari looks 
         ok except for some minor rendering issues relating to object borders 
         and dashed lines. For GhostBall Pool (#3d), Safari doesn't go to fullscreen
         well; use the full-canvas button instead.
         <br><br>
         Testing on the Raspberry Pi showed that Chromium looks good there and the 
         multiplayer works fine. RPi makes an excellent non-streaming client but is 
         very underpowered as a host. The right-side alt key is required for box selecting objects.
         <br><br>
         A Chromebook makes a good streaming and non-streaming client. As a host 
         it is somewhat underpowered. The touchpad differs from Windows. 
         Because of the way this site uses the alt key (for box-based object 
         selection), you must use a mouse to get right-click features like the 
         strongest mouse springs.
