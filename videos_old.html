      ::: Some snarky writing that got demoted to comments ::: 
      
      <p>The next section on games enlists some bad guys, computer drones 
      that travel along a path, searching for targets, and mercilessly 
      pummeling them with projectiles. Playing against these adversaries 
      leaves you with the eerie sense of something anticipating your moves, 
      expecting you to continue on course and walk into the trouble they send 
      your way. It's like riding on a clay pigeon as expert sportsmen aim 
      their shotguns ahead of your position, leading, accounting for the 
      movement that transpires after the shot, before the pellets reach the 
      target.</p> 

      <p>Is there any hope against such heartless skill, such guile, such 
      relentless focus? Well, no actually, zero hope, "zip, zilch, 
      nada." After a year of hosting Puck Popper, it appears that casual 
      attempts at the game don't go well: toasted, fried, popped, worse than 
      zero hope.</p> 
         
      <p>But I'm here, finally, to offer you a little help. You've tried 
      wild-eyed aggression (fun, but how did that go?). Yes, a glimmer of hope 
      will come in the form of insightful defensive maneuvers that set the 
      stage for a successful offense. This video provides you with the 
      technical insight, the mathematical savvy, the chutzpah, to take down 
      these bad boys in a blazing and decisive scorched-earth victory. 
      Generally, only released to those with the need-to-know and ultra 
      top-secret security clearances, this info is presented here, to you, yes 
      you.</p> 
      -->
      
      <p>This video starts with a <a href="images/leading-angle.png" 
      target="_blank">diagram</a> showing the relationship between the bullet 
	  and target velocities in Puck Popper (see next section). This is in the 
	  reference frame of the shooter (riding along) looking at the target. The 
	  idea is that the bullet will hit the target if the gun is angled such that 
	  its perpendicular component of velocity (perpendicular to the line between 
	  bullet and target) matches that of the target. This puts the bullet on the 
	  needed collision course (left-right movement matching the target). The 
	  other requirement is that the parallel component of velocity is such that, 
	  in time, the bullet will overtake the target and collide.</p> 
      
      <p>The video records a session of the 
	  <a href="index.html?8e" target="_blank">8e version</a> of the game. This version 
	  has settings that yield a nearly ideal environment for this aim-to-lead 
	  algorithm: (a) there are no drag 
      forces associated with puck movement, (b) all collisions are elastic. Note that the settings that make this good for the aiming algorithm, make 
      it harder to play. <a href="index.html?8c" target="_blank">8c</a> 
      is easier.<p>This algorithm is implemented in a very small amount of code. Take a look at the AimToLead 
      method in the Client prototype in the  
      constructorsAndPrototypes.js <a href="constructorsAndPrototypes.js.html" target="_blank">module</a>.</p>
	  <p>These calculations can be applied in estimating how to
      aim a shotgun, to lead, when skeet shooting. Assuming a muzzle velocity of 
      1200 fps, clay pigeon speed of 50 mph (73 fps), a shotgun length of 
      48 inches, and that your eye is about 3/4 of that length from the bead, 
      you can calculate how far the bead needs to be from the line of site to the target: 36 * (73/1200) = 2 inches.</p>

      These games were originally intended to be fertile ground,

      Especially the Puck Popper game was useful for
      parsing out small assignments that led to a completed game, all within the <a href="https://pet.timetocode.org/pe_tutorial_revhistory.html" target="_blank">scope</a> of a few weeks of class time... 
      So, of course, they are kind of cute and campy, and I think, 
      fun and playable. But that's for you to find out. They are short time-based games, that work well in small groups, couch co-op. No installs, no cost, cell phones are useful. Note the
      friendly-fire option under multiplayer; unselect it to team up against the drones.

      <p><strong class="title_2">Puck Popper</strong></p>
      
      <p>The Puck Popper game enlists computer drones that 
      travel along a path, searching for targets, anticipating their motion and 
      then shooting at them. The video in the previous section shows a drone puck working
      to clear out a set of targets. It sweeps the field, locks in, then
      aims the gun tube so as to lead the target, accounting for the movement
      that will happen after the shot.</p>   
         
      <p>Here are some tips that may help when playing against the drones and
      their aim-to-lead algorithm:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Move out of range of the sweeping rays. That's how the drones sees you.</li>
         <li>If they lock onto you, keep moving. Acceleration is good. Use your 
         jet, zig and zag. Evasive flying is fun with the <a onclick="scrollPage('network-connection');">virtual game 
         pad</a> (cell-phone controller).</li>
         <li>Back away. You can out run perfectly-aimed bullets in many cases.</li>
         <li>Bounce off a wall to confuse the drones.</li>
         <li>Use your shield (spacebar).</li>
         <li>Shoot at them. You're bullet stream will deflect the incoming.</li>
         <li>The drones' algorithm checks if there are drag forces on your puck, and 
         in those cases, it will split the difference between line-of-sight and 
         perfect-lead angle. So, if you can maintain speed (counter the drag 
         force with your jet), the drone will generally miss behind you.</li>
         <li>If you're using the virtual game pad (see videos below), try the 
         center touch point on the scope. That will instantly freeze your position 
         and possibly avoid leading shots. But don't stay in one 
         spot too long...</li>
         <li>Try the "f" key (almost cheating).</li>
         <li>Adjust the drag of your client puck. Grab it with your mouse, then 
         use the "&lt;" or "&gt;" keys to lower or raise the drag. The higher the 
         drag, the easier it is to drive, and the harder for the drones to 
         shoot you.</li>

      <p>To stop the madness, detangle. Straighten out the block of jello (no 
	  pucks touching each other) and the tangle timer stops. Pass the jello to 
	  your opponent. Lowest time wins.</p>   
         
      <p>Here are some tips that may help:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Spin the jello, grab and fling, using the right mouse button. 
		 Sometimes the whole thing will straighten out in one good spin.</li>
			 <li>Use the right-mouse button (to pull on a puck) quickly followed 
			 by a click of the &quot;f&quot; key.</li>
			 <li>Use the editor for more creative manipulations (see 6a tricks 
			 below). Depending on house rules, you may want to prohibit puck 
			 deletions.</li>

      is the use of the editor and capture features to create a custom version and save it for later use.

      While this is ideally played from one computer, this turn-taking approach can be adapted for use under social-distancing guidelines. All you
      need to do is share the capture (copy and paste it into an email), then load that capture (paste it into the capture box) 
      and run it (click the #6 button) on each computer. Your scores
      will be reported and ranked by the time it took you to straighten out the jello.</p>

      Editor can be handy for dealing with stubborn jello. This video shows ways to enlist it
      in separating those pucks. Any scheme that puts the light of day between the pucks, counts, a win.

      <p>In that it's probably more helpful to see the editor in use than to 
	  read about it, here are a few video examples. You can find

	  <a href="index.html" target="_blank" title="Springs &amp; Pucks">S&amp;P</a> 
	  page (see "editing" 
	  link in the outline). Here's a short summary of the keys used in 
	  editing: </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>"e" key enables (toggles) edits of walls and pins and makes hidden elements 
		  (like navigation springs) visible</li>
		  <li>arrow keys, - +, [ ], and < > increase or decrease various object properties </li>
		  <li>ctrl-x deletes a selected object or group</li>
		  <li>ctrl-v, ctrl-c, ctrl-s are used in replication</li>
		  <li>"alt" and "shift" keys are used with the mouse in selecting groups</li>
		  <li>"t" key (or shift-t) changes the rotation rate of selected objects</li>

      <p>First step: the "e" key is used to enable editing (copying) of the anchor pins behind the each three-puck system. 
      The "alt" key is held down while dragging the mouse to select a group. Then paste (replicate) the group at the position of the cursor using control-v.
      The "g" key is used to toggle the gravity on, then off. The right mouse button (strongest cursor spring) is used to get a good grip on one of the pucks and drag it around for
      mixing. Try this yourself and leave the wall/pin editor on to see the work that the springs do in restoring order to the multi-group system.</p>

      <p>The capture feature can be used to save work that you've created with the editor and then replay it. There are examples of this in the topics above

      <p>However, there are object attributes that can not be modified through

      <p><strong class="title_2">Adding angular momentum</strong></p>

      <p>The goal: demonstrate conservation of angular momentum by changing the spring lengths of the tri-puck object in demo 5a. (similar to how 
      figure skaters increase their rotation rate by pulling in their arms and legs during a spin) 
      The group must be centered so the longer springs don't cause the pucks to touch the walls.</p>
      
      <p>The method (a dash of physics): Do this by editing a capture of the centered system. Change the y component of velocity of two pucks such that the net change
      of their y components of momentum is zero. This causes rotation without causing movement of the system's center.</p>
      
      <p>Alternative method (without the capture edit or physics): use multi-select to copy the rotating trio, then paste to a centered cursor position
      with control-v, then delete the original trio (for the reader to try, not in the video).</p>
