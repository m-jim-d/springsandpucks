   This list of mouse, keyboard, and touch-screen actions is a reference for the features of the Springs and Pucks page.
   The "gui" column here indicates a corresponding button or checkbox.
   The "client" column indicates availability in the network client.
   The "r/a" column indicates a corresponding option in the "remove/add items" menu.
   </p><p>
   Ideally, try the S&P page (and read the left panel there), watch a few videos, then back here for reinforcement.
   However, this reference page can also be a place to explore and gather.
   Almost every interface feature is explained, enough for a try.
   The "virtual game pad" and the "remove/add items" menu are mentioned here (with links).
   </p><p>
   Note that the <a href="videos.html?interactions" target="_blank">interactions</a> section of the videos page serves as an introduction to the mouse/keyboard usage,
   especially those in the "move, rotate, and play" group below. 
   The videos are annotated, identifying the commands.

      If "lagtest" is in the chat field before checking "Local cursor" (inside "Multiplayer"), a circle is drawn to visualize the difference between the rendered cursor and system cursor. 
      Cursor speed is used to calculate the radius at 2-frames out from the rendered cursor.
      Note that unusual, persistent lag can be corrected by pausing ("p" key) and restarting ("p" key again) the animation loop. 
      This is done automatically after transitions that can occasionally cause a persistent lag (such as going in/out of full-screen display and changing browser tabs).
      Search for "lagTesting", "getLagTesting", and "restartAnimationLoop" in the code for more discussion.
