      <p>
      Without the effects of gravity in our 2D model, objects behave like balls on a pool table (or pucks on an air table). 
      Shots are aimed using a ghost-ball technique (the ghost of a cue ball).
      This forecasts the resulting motion after a collision with a puck or wall.
      </p><p> 
      Forecast lines are based on the contact normals for a ghost ball touching the surface of the object ball (or wall). 
      These collision forecasts are ideal in that the ghost ball is kept at the surface and does not penetrate the object. This is very close, 
      but not identical to the approximate collision calculations of Box2D. 
      For a discussion of ideal-contact-normal (exact) collision calculations, refer to the <a href="https://pet.triquence.org/?perfect-kiss" target="_blank" title="">perfect kiss</a> topic on the Python page.

      Do this by attaching a cursor spring (single-select) or by marking one or more objects as selected (multi-select). 
      Objects in a multi-select group are marked with a yellow dot. Selection can be done in two ways: 
      (1) drag the cursor over an object while the shift key is down (use the right mouse button to erase a mark), and

      shows the resulting system after adjusting spring length, spring strength, and hanging mass to produce a ratio of pendulum period to spring-bounce period
      of about 1.8. Ratios near 2 will produce a system that wanders back and forth between two modes: a pure vertical bouncing motion and a pure pendulum motion.
      The second clip has the ratio up near 5 and shows a spring oscillation superimposed on an orbit around the pin. The third clip had the unstretched length
      of the spring adjusted to zero and yields a period ratio of exactly 1.0.</p>
      
      <p>Puck color is varied by stepping through the lightness index in the HSL color space. "alt-p" toggles screen erasing on/off and shows motion history.
      The "f" key stops movement.</p>

      These games were originally intended to be fertile ground, 
      a coding environment for students in a college <a href="https://pet.triquence.org" target="_blank">J-term course</a> on Python. 
      Especially the Puck Popper game was useful for
      parsing out small assignments that led to a completed game, all within the <a href="https://pet.triquence.org/pe_tutorial_revhistory.html" target="_blank">scope</a> of a few weeks of class time... 
      So, of course, they are kind of cute, and I think, 
      fun and playable. But that's for you to find out. They are short time-based games, that work well in small groups, couch co-op. No installs, no cost, cell phones are useful. Note the
      friendly-fire option under multiplayer; unselect it to team up against the drones.

      <p>The Puck Popper game enlists computer drones that 
      travel along a path, searching for targets, anticipating their motion and 
      then shooting at them. The video in the previous section shows a drone puck working
      to clear out a set of targets. It sweeps the field, locks in, then
      aims the gun tube so as to lead the target, accounting for the movement
      that will happen after the shot.</p>

      <details>
      <summary title="click for details">Tips for playing against the drones and their aim-to-lead algorithm:</summary>
      <ul>
         <li>Move out of range of the sweeping rays. That's how the drones sees you.</li>
         <li>If they lock onto you, keep moving. Acceleration is good. Use your 
         jet, zig and zag. Evasive flying is fun with the <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="network-connection" href="#">virtual game 
         pad</a> (cell-phone controller).</li>
         <li>Back away. You can out run perfectly-aimed bullets in many cases.</li>
         <li>Bounce off a wall to confuse the drones.</li>
         <li>Use your shield (spacebar).</li>
         <li>Shoot at them. You're bullet stream will deflect the incoming.</li>
         <li>The drones' algorithm checks if there are drag forces on your puck, and 
         in those cases, it will split the difference between line-of-sight and 
         perfect-lead angle. So, if you can maintain speed (counter the drag 
         force with your jet), the drone will generally miss behind you.</li>
         <li>If you're using the virtual game pad (see videos below), try the 
         center touch point on the scope. That will instantly freeze your position 
         and possibly avoid leading shots. But don't stay in one 
         spot too long...</li>
         <li>Try the "f" key (almost cheating).</li>
         <li>Adjust the drag of your client puck. Grab it with your mouse, then 
         use the "&lt;" or "&gt;" keys to lower or raise the drag. The higher the 
         drag, the easier it is to drive, and the harder for the drones to 
         shoot you.</li>

      <p>The video here presents calculations of this kind yielding 1, 2, 3, and 5 digits of pi. 
      The 2D pucks provide a good visual representation of the 100,000,000 mass ratio in the 5-digit case. 
      Try this interactively by running 
	  <a href="index.html?1c" target="_blank" title="2 digits of Pi">1c</a>, 
	  <a href="index.html?1d" target="_blank" title="3 digits of Pi">1d</a>, and

      <p>The first two cases use the Box2D engine. Higher number of

      target="_blank">diagram</a> showing the relationship between the bullet 
	  and target velocities in <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="puckPopper" href="#">Puck Popper</a>. This is in the 
	  reference frame of the shooter (riding along) looking at the target. The 
	  idea is that the bullet will hit the target if the gun is angled such that 
	  its perpendicular component of velocity (perpendicular to the line between 
	  bullet and target) matches that of the target. This puts the bullet on the 
	  needed collision course (left-right movement matching the target). The 
	  other requirement is that the parallel component of velocity is such that, 
	  in time, the bullet will overtake the target and collide.</p> 
      
      <p>The video records a session of the 
	  <a href="index.html?8e" target="_blank">8e version</a> of the game. This version 
	  has settings that yield a nearly ideal environment for this aim-to-lead 
	  algorithm: (a) there are no drag 
      forces associated with puck movement, (b) all collisions are elastic. Note that the settings that make this good for the aiming algorithm, make 
      it harder to play. <a href="index.html?8c" target="_blank">8c</a> 
      is easier.<p>This algorithm is implemented in a very small amount of code. Take a look at the aimToLead 
      function in the <a href="puckPopper.js.html" target="_blank">puckPopper.js</a> module.</p>
	  <p>These calculations can be applied in estimating how to
      aim a shotgun, to lead, when skeet shooting. Assuming a muzzle velocity of 
      1200 fps, clay pigeon speed of 50 mph (73 fps), a shotgun length of 
      48 inches, and that your eye is about 3/4 of that length from the bead, 
      you can calculate how far the bead needs to be from the line of site to the target: 36 * (73/1200) = 2 inches.</p>

      <p>A modified shooting puck (from the Puck Popper game) is introduced here. It accounts for the physics of shooting
      a bullet (launching a little puck):
      
      <ul>
         <li>The mass of the system (the shooter and its bullets) is conserved. This means the mass of the bullet is taken from the shooter's puck (cannibalization).
         The reduced puck size is drawn with a decreased radius.</li>
         <li>The ejected mass (the bullet) starts its movement from the center of the shooter's puck.</li>
         <li>The shooter's puck has no drag (no external force).</li>
         <li>The shooter's jet behaves as usual in the Puck Popper game. It provides a pure external force: no accounting for exhaust mass, 
         and no accounting for interactions with other objects.</li>
      </ul>

      The center of mass of all the pucks is displayed as a small white circle with cross hairs. This is introduced in the 
      <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="systemCOM" href="#">System Center of Mass</a> topic above.</p>
      
      <p>The shooting puck is placed into three different floating fences: springy chain, chain, and triangle. Each of these fences is composed of rectangular pucks that contribute to
      the system center of mass. Whether inside or outside of the floating fence, the shooting puck is not able to move the SCM until it uses its jet (an external force).</p>

      <p>The balance of power, in Puck Popper, between the client pucks and drone pucks, can be adjusted by editing the capture.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>raycasting sweep <strong>rate and reach</strong>: the aggressiveness of the drones is partly established by their
         numbers and their navigation course (see topic above, <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="changingDronePath" href="#">Changing the drone path</a>). 
         The nature of the drones raycasting has an equally strong effect on how quickly they eliminate a target as is shown in the first two segments of this video.</li>
         
         <li><strong>bullet-life limit</strong>: short bullet-life will motivate more hand-to-hand combat, longer life will allow successful ricochet shots off the fence, even longer will 
         basically turn you into a fumigator.</li>
         
         <li><strong>recoil</strong>: turn off recoil to stay put while shooting.</li>
         
         <li>network clients <strong>starting positions</strong>: some positions are inherently more defensible. No hills here, but corners generally are good places to take a stand.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The host's puck is a template for all the network-client pucks. That keeps it fair if you are playing against each other and not only
      teaming up against the drones. Edit the following attributes on the host puck and you will see the same attributes on the network client pucks: 
      <i>radius_m, hitLimit, noRecoil, linDamp, restitution, restitution_fixed, friction, friction_fixed</i>. As shown in the video, the starting positions and velocities,
      for each of the first four network clients, can be set in <i>startingPosAndVels</i> near the end of the capture.

      <p><strong class="title_2">Adding angular momentum</strong></p>

      <p>The goal: demonstrate conservation of angular momentum by changing the spring lengths of the tri-puck object in demo 5a. (similar to how 
      figure skaters increase their rotation rate by pulling in their arms and legs during a spin) 
      The group must be centered so the longer springs don't cause the pucks to touch the walls.</p>
      
      <p>The method (a dash of physics): Do this by editing a capture of the centered system. Change the y component of velocity of two pucks such that the net change
      of their y components of momentum is zero. This causes rotation without causing movement of the system's center.</p>
      
      <p>Alternative method (without the capture edit or physics): use multi-select to copy the rotating trio, then paste to a centered cursor position
      with control-v, then delete the original trio (for the reader to try, not in the video).</p>
